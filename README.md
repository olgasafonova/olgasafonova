# Hi, I'm Olga

I build tools for AI-assisted development, focusing on MCP servers and Claude Code skills.

## Featured Projects

### SkillCheck

Validate Claude Code skills against the [agentskills specification](https://agentskills.io).

**[SkillCheck Free](https://github.com/olgasafonova/SkillCheck-Free)** — Skill-based validator (MIT)

**[SkillCheck Pro](https://getskillcheck.com)** — MCP server with anti-slop, security, WCAG checks

### MCP Servers

Go-based MCP servers for whiteboards, wikis, roadmaps, registries, and financial data:

**[miro-mcp-server](https://github.com/olgasafonova/miro-mcp-server)** — Build boards, sticky grids, and Mermaid diagrams from conversation instead of dragging shapes one by one

**[mediawiki-mcp-server](https://github.com/olgasafonova/mediawiki-mcp-server)** — Find, edit, and audit wiki content from AI conversation. Catch broken links and stale pages automatically. Search inside pages and uploaded files. Bulk-replace terms across categories

**[productplan-mcp-server](https://github.com/olgasafonova/productplan-mcp-server)** — Pull roadmap status, OKR progress, and idea backlogs into conversation instead of switching apps. Read and write roadmaps, OKRs, ideas, and launches through AI. Includes an eval suite for tool selection accuracy

**[nordic-registry-mcp-server](https://github.com/olgasafonova/nordic-registry-mcp-server)** — Look up companies across Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden through one interface instead of four government websites. Registrations, roles, branches, and annual reports across four countries

**[gleif-mcp-server](https://github.com/olgasafonova/gleif-mcp-server)** — Validate LEI codes, trace corporate ownership, and cross-reference BIC/ISIN identifiers for KYC and compliance. Look up legal entities by LEI, BIC, ISIN, or name. Built for KYC workflows and regulatory reporting

### Libraries & Infrastructure

Go libraries for MCP server developers:

**[mcp-otel-go](https://github.com/olgasafonova/mcp-otel-go)** — OpenTelemetry middleware for go-sdk MCP servers. One function call adds tracing and metrics following the OTel semantic conventions for MCP. Works with Jaeger, Grafana, Datadog, Honeycomb, or any OTLP backend

### MCP Workshop

**[mcp-workshop](https://olgasafonova.github.io/mcp-workshop/presentation.html)** — 1-hour workshop covering what MCPs are, how to use them, and how to build them. Presented for [Women in Product Nordics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-in-product-nordics) & [TechWomen Copenhagen](https://www.linkedin.com/company/techwomen-copenhagen). Includes a GLEIF starter kit with platform-specific setup guides.

### Lazgi Hands

**[lazgi-hands](https://olgasafonova.github.io/lazgi-hands/)** — Interactive visualization teaching Lazgi, a traditional Khorezm dance (UNESCO heritage). Uses algorithms from the birthplace of algorithms.
